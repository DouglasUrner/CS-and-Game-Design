# Planning Your Application

## What does it mean To you?

What motivates your interest in computer science and/or game design? A brief story about how your experience with games or a computer science class made an impact on your life is a great place to start. Did a game help with see people differently, or help you through a hard time? Did your experience in a class cause you to see yourself or your goals differently? These are good places to start.

## What would you like your contribution to be?

A career is (or at least can be) more than a paycheck. How would you like to use your education as a computer scientist or game designer to change to world (even just in small ways)?

Here are some examples of work game designers have done with the hope of making the world a better place:

* [The illuminating benefits of video games](https://www.ted.com/playlists/661/the_illuminating_benefits_of_videos_games) -- Are video games eroding our minds? These TED Talks suggest the opposite -- that video games can improve our brain function, and even help better the world.
* [Games for Change](https://gamesforchange.org) -- Games for Change is an organization that encourages and supports game designers building games to address social problems.
